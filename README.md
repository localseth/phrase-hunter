## Custom CSS
I added two subtle custom css featurues to this project.
* The first one is a `:hover` style for `button` elements so they will have a reduced opacity indicating that the button is currently in the scope of the cursor. 
* Secondly, the when the `show` class is added to one of the letter elements, the transition time is set to 0.25 seconds for a smoother appearance.

Thanks for checking out this project. Enjoy!
